  Live remote pair programming session with two Speedoc engineers.
  The interviewer reviews each line of code as the candidate writes it. This should be interactive, where the candidate asks questions and explains their thought process as they solve the problem. The interviewer can also provide nudges to set the candidate in the right direction in case they get stuck along the way. Through this process, you can learn how the candidate thinks, and how they would interact with your team members.

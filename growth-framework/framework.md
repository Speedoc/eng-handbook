# Speedoc Engineering Growth Framework

### [Individual Contributor - Delivery](tracks/ic_delivery.md)
Engineers at Speedoc are free to join a track which they are qualified for and approved by their management. The individual contributor tracks are focused around squad participation and organizational contributions.

### [Engineering Management](tracks/eng-management.md)

Engineering Managers focus on their team's growth, progression, performance, and well-being. Engineering Managers build and improve on department processes and frameworks. Engineering Managers may contribute technically to squads, and also know enough about the tech stack to contribute to cross-departmental discussions and queries.

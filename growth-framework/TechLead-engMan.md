# Tech Lead vs. Engineering Manager
It is very common for companies to mix the Tech Lead and Engineering Manager roles. Although both roles have some overlap, their focus is different: the Tech Lead is in charge of the *System* while the Engineering Manager is in charge of the *People*.

If the team is small and/or the leader has a lot of experience as Engineering Manager and Tech Lead, the same person might perform both roles. But as the system and team grow in size and complexity, there might be an opportunity to have different people for each role.

The following is a non-exhaustive list that exemplifies some of the different responsibilities of each role:

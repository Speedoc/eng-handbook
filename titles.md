# Titles
At Speedoc you are free to use a *working title* of your choice. This title should be approved as appropriate by your direct report. Feel free to express yourself based on your duties and role in the team.

While your working title can be anything, there is also a *corporate title* which is assigned based on your current level in the appropriate track (e.g. Development Engineer 3, DevOps Engineer 2, etc. )

### Career Ladder

<hr>

### Tracks

The default tracks for engineers are in the individual contributor tracks. Those who progress along the individual contributor track will typically be expert coders, they understand deeply the business context and problem space they're working in and may have a seat across more than one squad.

The skills you can develop and the impact you create as an Engineering Manager is quite different to other roles in engineering, therefore a different growth track exists and can be found below.

Tech Lead and Manager position availability is determined by the needs of the organization. 

- [Individual Contributor](#individual-contributor---delivery)
- [Management](#engineering-management)
- [Tech Lead vs. Engineering Manager](#tech-lead-vs-engineering-manager)

<hr>

#### Individual Contributor - Delivery
Engineers at Speedoc are free to join a track which they are qualified for and approved by their management. This allows you to choose how you can make the most impact possible within Engineering and in which track you'd like to progress. The individual contributor tracks are focused around squad participation and organizational contributions. 

The following tracks are available in the delivery category:
- [Test Engineer](#delivery---test-engineer)
- [Platform Engineer](#delivery---platform-engineer)
- [Development Engineer](#delivery---development-engineer)
- [Tech Lead](#delivery---tech-lead)

#### Tech Lead vs. Engineering Manager
It is very common for companies to mix the Tech Lead and Engineering Manager roles. Although both roles have some overlap, their focus is different: the Tech Lead is in charge of the *System* while the Engineering Manager is in charge of the *People*.

If the team is small and/or the leader has a lot of experience as Engineering Manager and Tech Lead, the same person might perform both roles. But as the system and team grow in size and complexity, there might be an opportunity to have different people for each role.

The following is a non-exhaustive list that exemplifies some of the different responsibilities of each role:

| [Tech Lead](#delivery---tech-lead) (System) | [Engineering Manager](#engineering-management) (People)|
| :--- | :--- |
| Technical Excellence and Innovation| Career Planning, Promotions and Coaching |
| Architecture and System Integration | Headcount Planning and Hiring |
| Tech Mentoring, Adoption and Alignment | Team Planning and Delivery |
| Technical Spikes and Experiments​ | Objectives, Performance and Feedback |
| Code Reviews and Feedback | One on Ones |
| System Design Presentations​ | Participation in Technical Decisions |
| Technical Capacity Planning​ | Cascading Communications​ |
| Production Issues Escalation​ | Team Building Activities and Culture​ |
| System SLAs, Metrics & Monitoring​ | Team Protection and Happiness​ |
| Platform Direction, Patterns and Practices | Team Productivity and Metrics​ |
| Alignment with other Tech Leads​ | Alignment with other Dev Managers​ |
| Hands-On Coding 30% to 70% of the Time | Hands-On Coding 0% to 30% of the Time |
| System Roadmap (shared)​ | System Roadmap (shared)​ |
| Development Process (shared)​ | Development Process (shared)​ |
| Team Visibility and Recognition (shared) | Team Visibility and Recognition (shared)​ |
| Ability to Act as Engineering Manager when Required | Ability to Act as Tech Lead when Required |

### Growth

#### Levels

We'll periodically be evolving and upgrading the levels, making them more detailed, more relevant, and expanding them. This may involve existing levels or building into levels that don't exist yet, ie level 7+.

An individual would be expected to build on their skills evenly and consistently - so that there is no more than +-1 deviation in their attributes achieved across the level framework. In other words, an engineer could be mostly L5 and may have one or two attributes that are L4 or L6 but we expect that they would build on their L4 skills first.

An engineer is expected to achieve ~80% of attributes of the next level to be considered for promotion. You can progress without meeting every single ability and action in a level.

<hr>

#### Scope - Individual Contributor
IC Tracks currently have up to 7 levels.

When looking at the levels within a track, it is important to recognise the the *scope* of ownership that is expected by each level.

| Level | Ownership|
| :--- | :--- |
| Level 1 | Small pieces of well-defined work within a squad, with the assistance of others |
| Level 2 | Independently works on small tasks within a squad |
| Level 3 | Feature / deliverable |
| Level 4 | Squad |
| Level 5 | Squad and Chapter |
| Level 6 | Across more than one squad and chapter |
| Level 7 | Across the whole company |

#### Scope - Engineering Manager

Engineering Managers have three levels (I, II, and III).

As with the engineering individual contributor growth framework, when looking at the various , it's important to recognise at which scope each level applies to.

| Level | Ownership |
| :--- | :--- |
| Level 1 | Engineering Management Team and Engineering |
| Level 2 | Engineering Management Team, Engineering, and R&D (Product) |
| Level 3 | Engineering Management Team, Engineering, R&D (Product), and Company-wide. |

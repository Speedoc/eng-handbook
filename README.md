## Progression Framework


### Career Ladder

![Career Track](../img/Eng%20Career%20Paths.jpeg)

#### Individual Contributor - Delivery
Engineers at Speedoc are free to join a track which they are qualified for and approved by their management. The individual contributor tracks are focused around squad participation and organizational contributions.

#### Engineering Management

Engineering Managers focus on their team's growth, progression, performance, and well-being. Engineering Managers build and improve on department processes and frameworks. Engineering Managers may contribute technically to squads, and also know enough about the tech stack to contribute to cross-departmental discussions and queries.

##### Delivery - QA Engineer

The support track is where QA analysts and engineers will start at Speedoc. Team members here contribute to their squads with manual testing, writing automated tests, and coordinating continuous and integrated delivery with platform engineers and development engineers.

##### Delivery - Platform Engineer

Our platform engineers are responsible for maintaining our network architecture, cloud services, and CI/CD workflows.

##### Delivery - Development Engineer

Development engineers work on feature squads that work cross-functionally with product teams to deliver increments of value
##### Delivery - Tech Lead

Tech Leads own the technical direction of the squad and coordinate team efforts. They are responsible for helping set up squad goals, future milestones, and ensuring high standards of quality. Tech leads are responsible for the output of the squad

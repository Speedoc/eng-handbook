## Onboarding

### Set-up & Tooling

- Make sure you are in the engineering@speedoc.com google group. This group is used for calendars and file permissions.
- Join the @engineering slack group to be included in all general engineering channels such as #engineering_general and #product_engineer
- Join your team slack group such as @jarvis_devteam. This will give you access to the team/squad-specific channels.
- Axolo is a tool we use to connect and sync github events and conversations with slack. In slack, please go to the @Axolo channel and sign in with github credientials and also connect your slack to the Axolo bot. There are 2 separate login events you should do here.
- Set up your local development environment. If you encounter any issues, ask for help in Slack and then update the documentation to reflect the resolution (so the next engineer that we hire doesn’t run into the same problem).

### Probation Period
Speedoc will make an effort to ensure that its hiring procedures serve the purpose of recruiting the best employees for each open position. However, we acknowledge that they are inevitably not always accurate in predicting performance or determining appropriate cultural fit. The probation period for new employees gives both employee and employer enough time to find out if their employment relation will eventually work out to the benefit of both.

#### What is the meaning of probation period?
The probationary period definition for new employees is the time between signing an employment contract and being granted permanent employment status. It is a “trial period” during which the employee is being evaluated as a suitable fit to the position and the company. The new employee will be given consistent feedback and coaching to have the chance to learn their new job and improve during the probationary period. At the end of the probation period (or possibly before that), the supervisor will determine if the employee should be retained in the organization. This decision will be made by appraising the following criteria:

- The skills, competencies and knowledge of the employee on the job
- The employee’s progress on given assignments
- Their reliability, trustworthiness and other relevant personality characteristics of the employee
- The employee’s relations and collaboration with subordinates, supervisors and peers

The abovementioned criteria will be assessed with quantitative measures if applicable. Their progress will be documented whenever possible, and the decision to retain them will be at the supervisor’s discretion.

Further details about *probation period* can be found by contacting hr@speedoc.com and in the Employee Handbook.
